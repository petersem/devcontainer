# Sample JS Demo Project
Project shows some client-side JS and server-side JS (node js)
## Just a demo!

> **Note**
> 
> For fun, this is also a Docker Dev container. (The VS Code project, dependencies, extensions, and additions, are all running in a container.)
> This includes the addition of a MYSQL Server docker container, running docker-in-docker configuration.
>
> You can ignore the docker dev container stuff, or try it out. 
> You will need the following:
>
> - VS Code
> - Docker Desktop
> - The Docker Dev Container VS Code extension. 
>
> Then do a `ctrl - shift - p` to open the vs code pallete menu and type `Reopen folder in container`
>
> You will notice that it takes a little while, but this is just the first time. Once it opens, you will have:
>
> - Customised VS Code settings and theme
> - Node JS installed
> - Docker installed
> - TypeScript install
> - Various plugins installed, like ESLINT and LiveServer
> - A docker container running MYSQL DB.
>
> *All of this is within the dev container, not installed directly on your machine*
>
> Do a `ctrl - shift - p`, then `reopen folder locally` to exit the dev container.
